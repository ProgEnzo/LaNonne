    A nun with a blade? You are more weird than me!


    I
    have to write it on a post-it. I NEED to remember this information!


    ...Damn!
    I can''t find a blank one!'
  - 'Who are you!?


    I don''t trust people who believe in something greater than
    them. First, believe in yourself, then, you''ll see...


    Look, personally,
    I believe in these post-its. They remember things for me. Can the subject of
    your belief do the same?
